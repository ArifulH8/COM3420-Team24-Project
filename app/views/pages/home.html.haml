              %p If extenuating circumstances are affecting your ability to engage with your course, you can submit a form to your department requesting they be taken into consideration when grading you. You should notify your academic department of any extenuating circumstances at the earliest possible opportunity. Before applying for extenuating circumstances you must read the relevant information below. We seek to respond in an equitable and consistent way to all requests for extenuating circumstances. As well as considering your needs, we also consider academic integrity and fairness to other students.

              %h2.display-4 What are extenuating circumstances?
              %p Extenuating circumstances are exceptional, short-term events (eg personal or health problems) which are outside of your control and have a negative impact on your ability to prepare for or take (sit) an assessment.  To meet the criteria of extenuating circumstances, they must also: be non-academic (problems with the management of your course or academic staff should be dealt with via the student complaints procedure)  be out of your control (ie you couldn’t reasonably have done anything to prevent them from happening); and have occurred at the time of the assessment or in the period immediately leading up to the assessment It’s your responsibility to notify your tutor, supervisor or other appropriate departmental staff if there are any extenuating circumstances that may have a bearing on your ability to perform for your exams/assessments.

              %li Bereavement – death of close relative/significant other (which in an employment context would have led to a period of compassionate leave).
              %li Serious short term illness/accident/hospitalisation (which in an employment context would have led to a period of sickness absence).
              %li Deterioration or fluctuation of a disability or long term health condition.
              %li Significant adverse personal/family circumstances.
              %li Other significant exceptional factors for which there is evidence of stress caused, eg being a victim of crime. We’ll likely require evidence of any of these (eg police crime reference, letter from hospital/doctor treating condition, social worker letter).

              %p Academic staff (eg the exam board) will take your extenuating circumstances into account when deciding your academic outcomes. If your circumstances are deemed to be appropriately and genuinely extenuating, academic staff can suggest the following:
              %ul
              %li No further action.
              %li Disregarding penalties for late submission of coursework.
              %li Not Assessing (NA) the exam/module in question and providing you another attempt without academic penalty. This would only happen if you failed or didn’t attend your exam and evidence strongly suggests that you’ve been seriously disadvantaged by your circumstances.
              %li Disregarding a missing component and deriving an overall mark/grade from completed work. 
              %li Disregarding an unreliable component and deriving an overall mark from completed work (if it will benefit you).
              %li Submitting the missing assessment if you fail your course.
              %li Sitting an alternative assessment if you fail your course.

You don’t need to provide additional medical evidence if you submit an extenuating circumstances form based on:    
              %ul
              %li the impact of a condition/impairment that’s outlined on your Learning Support Plan from DDSS
              %li the deterioration/fluctuation of a disability and your Learning Support Plan from DDSS outlines that your disability is variable
              %p If you’re submitting an extenuating circumstances form based on a condition/impairment documented in your Learning Support Plan, you should provide clear information about the impact this has had on the modules/assessments. You do need to provide additional medical evidence if you’re on a professional course (eg Medicine).

              %ul
              %li You submitted late because you didn’t feel comfortable notifying your department of your circumstances prior to the relevant meetings/boards.
              %li You wanted to await your results before presenting this information.
              %p The process is confidential, but your academic appeals form and any supporting evidence will be shared with: 
              %ul 
              %li your Head of Department(s) or delegate 
              %li other University staff whose input is deemed necessary to consider your case
              %li a Faculty Officer and the administrators of the process 
              %p An extenuating circumstance form will only be seen by a small number of staff in your department.
